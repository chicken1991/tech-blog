  ## Description
  This is a techblog style website that demonstrates my ability to build a database backend with mysql and sequelize that stores data for express.js to serve pages utilizing handlebars. Tech used: node, express, handlebars, mysql, sequelize, dotenv, and others. You can sign up, post your own blog post, and even comment on other posts (as long as you are signed in).
